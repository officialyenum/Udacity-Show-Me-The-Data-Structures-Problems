Submission to Udacity's SHOW-ME-THE-DATA-STRUCTURES Problems

Run time analysis (Worst Case Big-O Notation) of solution

Get Time Taken to run using : time python <filename>

- Why i used List data structure to solve this problem ?

This problem requires me to check if a user exists in a list of users from a group class. my solution uses the 0(n) complexity to search through the group list and return a boolean value

- TASK 4 : 0(n)
  - Algorithm for is_user_in_group Function :

    - get users in group class 0(1)
    - Traverse through list of users 0(n)
    - Return the boolean 0(1)
